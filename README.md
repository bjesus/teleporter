# Tab Teleporter

Teleporter aims to be the fastest way to jump between open tabs in your web-browser.

## How to use

1. Open the Teleporter panel using the "play" button of your keyboard
2. Filter through the list with the simple fuzzy search input box
3. One there's only one result, Teleporter will open it automatically
4. You can always type the tab number and Teleporter will open it even if more results are visible

## Why play button

WebExtension requires two keys shortcuts except for the keyboard media buttons that can be used alone. To be the fastest way to jump between tabs, Teleporter needs to be one click away. If you don't have the key in your keyboard, you'd need to set up some key remapping. On Linux, try editing `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet` or `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/evdev` and configure whatever key you want as `XF86AudioPlay`. I haven't tried it but it seems that you can use [Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) on Windows and [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on MacOS.

## Now I don't need my tabs bar

That's the point! On Firefox you hide it completely [by editing your userChrome.css](https://superuser.com/questions/1268732/how-to-hide-tab-bar-tabstrip-in-firefox-57-quantum). I have no idea if it's possible on other browsers.
